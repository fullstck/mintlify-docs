| Environment      | Base URL |
| -----------------| -------- |
| Production       | https://api.stream.estate    |
| Staging   | https://staging.api.stream.estate       |

<Tip>
When using the `Staging` environment, keep in mind that the data is static and may not represent real-time or complete datasets. 

To obtain meaningful results, consider making **broader queries**. This helps ensure you retrieve relevant data points, even within the limited sandbox dataset. 

When you transition to the `Production` environment, you'll be able to execute more specific queries with dynamic and comprehensive data.
